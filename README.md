Fuzzy-ish type maching
----------------

Thanks to [natecavanaugh](https://github.com/natecavanaugh) contribute now are allowed a fuzzy-ish type matching of the names of projects; for instance, if you have 3 projects such as:

- dotfiles
- Liferay Dev
- Liferay Plugins

Typing `de` will give you `dotfiles` and `Liferay Dev`.
Typing `lfr` will give you both `Liferay Dev` and `Liferay Plugins`.
Typing `ldev` will give you just `Liferay Dev`.

This fits more with how fuzzy matching is done in Sublime and makes it really easy to select projects.
